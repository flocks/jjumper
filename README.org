* jjumper.el

Quickly jump to a nested key in a json buffer

** Overview

[[https://github.com/flocks/jjumper/raw/main/jjumper.gif]]

** Installation

You can just put `jjumper.el` somewhere in your *load-path* and eval the file.
You can also use use-package with straight:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package jjumper
	:straight (jjumper :type git :host github :repo "flocks/jjumper")
	:config
	(define-key json-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-j") 'jjumper-jump-key))
#+END_SRC


* Usage

The most common usecase, is to bind *jjumper-jump-key* to some convenience keychord
in *json-mode-map*

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key json-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-j") 'jjumper-jump-key)
#+END_SRC

** Other usecases

Since it's using native completion system (*completing-read*), you can leverage
*embark* for copying the path, or inserting somewhere.

I personnaly use it in a frontend application, where all translations keys are stored
in a single json file. I can quickly search and insert a path in my code with the
following snippet:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun ft-insert-translation-key ()
	"Insert a translation key"
	(interactive)
	(let ((key (with-current-buffer
				   (find-file-noselect "~/project/path/to/translation.json")
				 (jjumper--prompt (jjumper--get-json-in-buffer)))))
	  (insert key)))
#+END_SRC


* Todo

- It doesn't handle array for now, because I personnally don't really need it. But
  I definitely will handle that soon.
